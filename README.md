# Little Gemma

A small, from-scratch C program that loads a model stored in **GGUF** and runs it —
written to *teach* how a modern LLM actually executes, in the spirit of Karpathy's
`llama2.c` but covering a current model (Gemma) and aimed at **CUDA**.

It is a complete pipeline: parse GGUF → BPE tokenize → run the transformer →
generate text. Every stage was validated bit-for-bit against `llama.cpp`.

```
text ──► tokenizer ──► token ids ──► forward ──► logits ──► argmax ──► next token
                          ▲                                                │

    graph.c — a minimal tensor/graph layer (matmul, rmsnorm, softmax, …)
            kept as the "what a compute graph is" teaching reference.
```

**Layering:** GGUF/ggml jargon stays in the lower layers (`gguf.c`, `quant.c`);
the model layer (`model.c`) reads like plain transformer code. The file is read
fully into RAM (no mmap — it errors out rather than silently paging), weights stay
quantized there, and each weight row is unpacked to f32 on the fly during matmul.

### What `model_forward` computes (Gemma 4 / E2B)

```
embed(token) × √d
for each of 35 layers:
    ├─ attention:  rmsnorm → Q,K,V → per-head Q/K-norm → NeoX RoPE
    │              → GQA (8 q-heads, 1 kv-head) with sliding-window OR global mask
    │              → KV cache (layers ≥15 reuse an earlier layer's KV)
    │              → output proj → post-norm → residual
    ├─ feed-forward (GeGLU):  rmsnorm → gelu(gate)·up → down → post-norm → residual
    │              (elastic FFN: width 6144 for layers 0–14, 12288 for 15–34)
    └─ per-layer input (PLE) + per-layer output scale
final rmsnorm → tied logits (× token_embd) → softcap
```

## How to Build

```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

### Release build (recommended — ~3.4× faster than Debug)

```
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Threading is via OpenMP (auto-detected by CMake); the matmul scales across cores.

### CUDA build (optional)

If the CUDA toolkit is found, CMake also builds a `run-cuda` target:

```
cmake --build build --config Release --target run-cuda
```

Same CLI as `run`. The CPU backend (`model-cpu.c`) and the CUDA backend
(`model-cuda.cu`) implement the same `model.h`; only the compute kernels differ.

## Usage

The CLI is just two flags:

```
run -m <model.gguf> [-p "prompt"]
```

- `-m` only → prints the GGUF dump + config, then exits.
- `-m` + `-p` → also tokenizes the prompt, generates, and reports tok/s.

```
> run -m model.gguf -p "The capital of France is"
The capital of France is Paris.
prompt: 6 tokens in 4.68s (1.28 tok/s)
gen:    2 tokens in 1.48s (1.35 tok/s)
```

## On SIMD (AVX2) — intentionally not implemented

The CPU matmul is plain scalar C parallelized with OpenMP; there are **no hand-written
AVX2/FMA intrinsics**. This is deliberate. Hand-vectorizing the CPU kernels would
be throwaway work, because the real target is **CUDA**: on the GPU the parallelism
comes from thousands of threads (replacing OpenMP) and the per-element math runs in
kernels (replacing what SIMD would do). The weights are already stored quantized
and unpacked inside the matmul — exactly the shape a GPU kernel wants — so the
CPU kernels in `model-cpu.c` (`matmul_q`, `rmsnorm`, `rope_neox`, `softmax`, `gelu`)
double as the reference spec for the CUDA versions in `model-cuda.cu`.

## On mmap — intentionally not used

Most GGUF runners memory-map the model file and let the OS page weights in on
demand. little-gemma instead reads the whole file into RAM up front and refuses to
start if it does not fit. This avoids the complexity — and the silent failure mode —
of paging: with mmap a model that is slightly too large still "loads", then thrashes
as the OS evicts weight pages and re-reads them from disk every token, so the
slowdown is invisible and hard to reason about. The rule here is deliberately
simple: if you have enough memory, you run; if you don't, you get a clear error at
load time instead of a mysterious crawl (`load_gguf` checks the size and bails).

## On CUDA

The whole forward, the kv cache, and every non-matmul kernel live in
`model-cuda-common.cuh`; the **matmul is the only thing that differs** between the two
GPU backends, so each is a thin file that includes the header and defines just
`matmul_q`. Diff `model-cuda.cu` against `model-cuda-i8.cu` to see exactly where
the speed comes from.

**`model-cuda.cu` — the readable f32 matmul.** Built up in four steps, each diffed
against the CPU output (byte-identical) before keeping it (E2B tok/s):

1. **matmul on the GPU, the rest on the host** — upload the quantized weights to
   VRAM once; a kernel unpacks each weight row and dots it. (7.9)
2. **activations resident in VRAM** — the whole forward and the KV cache live on
   the device, so only the embedding row (down) and the logits (up) cross the bus. (10)
3. **one warp per output row** instead of one thread — 32× the threads, so the
   small per-layer matmuls actually fill the GPU. (17)
4. **the warp cooperates on each block**, with per-element dequant fused into the
   dot — every lane stays busy and the per-row scratch buffer is gone. (36)

**`model-cuda-i8.cu` — the int8 matmul** (llama.cpp's `mul_mat_vec_q` idea,
simplified). The activation is the same for every output row, so quantize it to
int8 once per matmul (per 32-element group: a scale, the int8 values, and their
sum). The per-row dot is then done in **integer arithmetic** per weight sub-block —
with the float scale applied once per sub-block instead of once per element — and
each group of four products goes through `__dp4a`, the 4-way int8 dot-product
instruction. Because an integer dot is order-independent, this is **byte-identical**
to the scalar version: pure speedup, zero numerical change. (The int8 *activation*
is lossy, like every GPU inference engine, so the greedy path differs slightly from
f32, but the output stays coherent and accurate.)

Decode throughput (single token, all layers on GPU):

| model | f32 (`run-cuda`) | int8+dp4a (`run-cuda-i8`) | llama.cpp CUDA |
|-------|-----------------:|--------------------------:|---------------:|
| E2B   | ~35 tok/s        | ~63 tok/s                 | ~146 tok/s     |
| 12B   | ~15 tok/s        | ~32 tok/s                 | ~64 tok/s      |

So the int8 path is ~48× over the CPU backend (E2B) and closes the gap to
llama.cpp's heavily-tuned kernels from ~4× to ~2×. The remaining ~2× is structural
(warp specialization, tiling, tighter memory scheduling) — well beyond `dp4a`, and
left as future work.

## Performance vs llama.cpp (CPU, apples-to-apples)

Both **no CUDA, no SIMD intrinsics, 12 threads**, single-token generation:

| build                                         | generation |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------:|
| little-gemma (scalar + OpenMP)                | ~1.3 tok/s |
| llama.cpp (SIMD off, CUDA off, `llama-bench`) | 2.33 tok/s |

Only **~1.8×** apart. The gap is *algorithm*, not SIMD: llama.cpp quantizes the
activation to int8 once and does an integer `vec_dot` against the quantized
weights (never materializing f32), plus better cache blocking. little-gemma
dequantizes each weight row to f32 then does an f32 dot. With AVX2 *on*,
llama.cpp reaches ~10–30 tok/s on the same machine — that headroom is what CUDA
is for.

## Validation

Built against a CPU `llama.cpp` as an oracle (`llama-eval-callback` dumps every
intermediate tensor): dequantization is bit-exact vs the `gguf` Python package;
the forward pass matches an independent NumPy f32 reference and llama.cpp's logits
(within the f32-vs-quantized-matmul gap); the tokenizer matches `llama-tokenize`
exactly. `test/graph_test.c` (a CTest target) checks the graph kernels.
